## The History of Himalayan Mountaineering Expeditions

This week, we are exploring mountaineering data from the Himalayan Dataset!

The Himalayan Database is a comprehensive archive documenting mountaineering expeditions in the Nepal Himalaya. 
It continues the pioneering work of Elizabeth Hawley, a journalist who dedicated much of her life to cataloging climbing history in the region. 
Her meticulous records were initially compiled from a wide range of sources, including books, alpine journals, and direct correspondence with Himalayan climbers.

To manage file size, the expeditions file was filtered down to 2020-2024.
