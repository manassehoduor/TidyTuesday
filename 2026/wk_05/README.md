#TidyTuesday week 5: Exploring edible plants! The Edible Plant Database (EPD) is an outcome of the GROW Observatory, a European Citizen Science project on growing food, soil moisture sensing and land monitoring. It contains information on 146 edible plant species, including their ideal growing conditions and time to harvest and germination.
