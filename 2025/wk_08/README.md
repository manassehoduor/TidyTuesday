## Academic Literature on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Reproductive Medicine in the US

This week we're exploring data on studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine as published in the eight highest impact peer-reviewed Ob/Gyn journals from January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2023. The data were collected as part of a review article Racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine in the United States: a narrative review of contemporary high-quality evidence published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in January 2025.

"There has been increasing debate around how or if race and ethnicity should be used in medical researchâ€”including the conceptualization of race as a biological entity, a social construct, or a proxy for racism. The objectives of this narrative review are to identify and synthesize reported racial and ethnic inequalities in obstetrics and gynecology (ob/gyn) and develop informed recommendations for racial and ethnic inequity research in ob/gyn."
